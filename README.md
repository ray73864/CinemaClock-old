CinemaClock is a program i created about 10yrs ago to fill a need for the mobile cinema that i work for during cinema season.

Cinemaclock allows you to show something up on screen instead of just having a blank screen, making your mobile cinema outfit look more professional.

The CinemaClock displays the current time up on the screen, allows you to run powerpoint presentations for setting up your screen at each location (Focus slides for 4:3, 16:9 and 2.35:1),
as well as allowing you to run currently up to 2 different presentations for the start of the show.
